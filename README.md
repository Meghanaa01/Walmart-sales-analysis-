Walmart Sales Analysis Project
End-to-End SQL + Python Project

Project Overview
This project delivers a comprehensive data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. Leveraging Python for data processing, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving methods, this project is ideal for aspiring data analysts aiming to strengthen skills in data manipulation, complex SQL querying, and end-to-end data pipeline development.

Project Workflow
1. Environment Setup
Tools: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Python, SQL (MySQL & PostgreSQL)

Objective: Organize a clean and efficient workspace and project folder structure to facilitate smooth development and data management.

2. Kaggle API Configuration
Process:

Download Kaggle API token from your Kaggle profile settings (kaggle.json).

Place it in the .kaggle folder on your local machine.

Use the Kaggle API to download datasets directly to your project environment.

3. Dataset Acquisition
Source: Walmart Sales Dataset on Kaggle

Dataset Link: Walmart Sales Dataset

Storage: Store datasets within the data/ directory for easy access.

4. Installation & Data Loading
Required Libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python psycopg2
Data Loading: Load datasets into Pandas DataFrames for initial exploration and cleaning.

5. Data Exploration
Conduct preliminary analysis to understand data distribution, inspect column names, data types, and identify anomalies using .info(), .describe(), .head().

6. Data Cleaning
Remove duplicates and handle missing data appropriately.

Convert data types where necessary (e.g., dates to datetime objects, prices to floats).

Standardize currency formats and validate data consistency.

7. Feature Engineering
Create new calculated columns such as Total Amount by multiplying unit_price and quantity to support revenue and sales analysis.

8. Database Integration
Establish connections with MySQL and PostgreSQL databases using SQLAlchemy.

Automate table creation and load cleaned data into both databases.

Verify data accuracy through sample queries.

9. SQL Analysis & Business Insights
Execute complex SQL queries to answer critical business questions including:

Revenue trends by branch and category

Best-selling product categories

Sales performance by time, city, and payment method

Peak sales periods and customer purchase behavior

Profit margin analysis by branch and category

10. Documentation & Project Publishing
Maintain comprehensive documentation of processes and insights.

Publish the project to GitHub with organized folder structure, including SQL scripts, notebooks, and README.

Project Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher

SQL databases: MySQL and/or PostgreSQL

Python libraries: pandas, numpy, sqlalchemy, mysql-connector-python, psycopg2
